Super mysterious steganograpy scripts to encode/decode messages in PNGs :secret: :shipit:

## Usage

### Encoding

echo -n \[msg\] | encode \[input_image.png\] \[output_image.png\] 

### Decoding
decode [image.png]

It has some bugs and you can only encode msg in ASCII. Also it uses a pretty basic method of steganography so don't go around sending animu pics to your terrorist friends with hidden homo love messages, you'll get caught.
